# General
Does the .zip file follow the instructions? (report.pdf, authors.txt, reproducibility script or instruction, all necessary code in src/)
- Yes

Does the report appear to follow the length limit, font size, and margin requirements?
- Yes, slightly longer than two pages text

Can the experiments be reproduced?

# Exercise 1
Does the code snippet compute the desired function correctly and efficiently?
- Yes

How could the code be improved or simplified?
- No, uses binary and bit shift. Maybe for readability you could divide the code into two or three lines, this is the code snippet: res +=  (Integer.bitCount(A[i] & x) % 2) << (31-i);

Other comments?
- 

# Exercise 2
Is the implementation of rho correct? (beware off-by-one errors)
- Off by one  

How can the plot be improved?
- Ok plot, but they are off by one. 0 leading zeros leads to "first set bit at position 1" not "... at position 0" as one might expect. So x axis should start at 1. 

Is the discussion convincing and complete?
- See above

Other comments?
- No

# Exercise 3
How can the implementation of the hyperloglog counter be improved?
- Seems correct all way through but the code is divided into many functions, e.g. the logarithm is defined as a function in the code. Could be shorter and more precise. 

Does the stated estimate appear to be correct?
- Yes, got exactly the same

Other comments?
- No

# Exercise 4
Is the input generator appropriate and are all generated values distinct?
- I am not quite sure. As far as I understand random.nextInt(a) has 0 as the lower bound and a as the upper bound. They are generating input this way: "int i = a + random.nextInt(-a + b + 1)" and from the report I understand that a is lower bound and b upper bound on the range, but is this the case?

Are the plots useful?
- Yes

Does the table contain reasonable results?
- Yes, very close to expected values in the paper
